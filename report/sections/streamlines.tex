\chapter{Streamlines} % (fold)
\label{cha:streamlines}

A streamline is the curved path of an imaginary particle that is released at some start location, a seed point, in a stationary vector field\cite{telea2014data}. Where glyphs give a general overview of the flow within the vector field, a streamline visualize the localized aspect. Multiple streamlines can of course be used to generate a more general overview of the flow within the vector field. A disadvantage of streamlines compared to glyphs is that they have no direction. 

\Cref{s:streamlines:method} discuss the computation of streamlines, in \cref{s:streamlines:design} the considerations that guided our design of streamlines are presented. And finally \cref{s:streamlines:results} shows and discusses our results.
