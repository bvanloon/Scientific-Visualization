This document accompanies the visualization application made for the course Scientific Visualization at the University of Groningen. The application provides different methods and engines to visualize a real-time fluid flow simulation. This simulation calculates the values of quantities such as fluid density and fluid velocity over time. In \cref{cha:skeleton_compilation} the simulation is shortly discussed as well as the techniques used to develop the simulation. Next \cref{cha:color_mapping} discusses the different colormaps available in the application.
