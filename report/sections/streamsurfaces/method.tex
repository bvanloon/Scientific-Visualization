\section{Method}
\label{s:streamsurfaces:method}
This section explains how one can define a stream surface given a seed curve \seedCurve, with $n$ vertices, $\seedCurveVertex{0}, \cdots ,\seedCurveVertex{n}$ and $T$ 2D vector fields, $\vectorFieldDiscTime{}{0}, \cdots, \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{T}$,  that represent the different states of some vector field as a function of time.


In \cref{s:streamsurface:method:time} we explain how we compute a three dimensional streamline in a number of consecutive two dimensional datasets. \Cref{s:streamsurface:method:seedCurve} explain how we compute the seed points given the seed curve \seedCurve. \Cref{s:streamsurface:method:surface} discusses how we define a stream surface from a set of streamlines. 

\subsection{Time as the Third Dimension}
\label{s:streamsurface:method:time}
We start the streamline at seed point \seedPoint{0} in the 2D vector field \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{T}, \ie the oldest vector field that we have. We then compute the next vertex of the 2D streamline in the vector field \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{T} with seed point \seedPoint{0}. We refer to this 2D position as \seedPoint{1}. This position is used as the seed point of a 2D streamline of one edge in the vector field \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{T - 1}. The other vertex of that edge is referred to as \seedPoint{2}, and is used as the seed point in \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{T - 2}. This process is repeated until we have reached \vectorFieldDiscTime{}{0}. 

The points $\seedPoint{0}, \cdots, \seedPoint{T}$ define the three dimensional stream line. The \textit{z}-coordinate of these points is computed in such a way that the points are spread uniformly in \textit{z} over some predefined range for \textit{z}.


The streamline is thus computed according to the process described in \cref{cha:streamlines}, with one change: there is no lower bound for the magnitude, \ie $\magnitudeMin = \infty$.

\subsection{From a Seed Curve to Seed Points}
\label{s:streamsurface:method:seedCurve}
The seed curve is a polyline, each of the line segments of this polyline
