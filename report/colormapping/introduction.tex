\Cref{fig:colormapping:xray} shows a well known example of the use of a color map. In this image lighter colors are used to indicate areas where the density of the X-rayed object are high, whereas darker colors represent areas of low density. X-rays use gray scale color maps, that is it maps the density values of the object to colors ranging from black to white. \Cref{s:colormapping:introduction} discusses the gray scale color map extensively and introduces other color maps. In \cref{ss:colormaps:parameterization} the parameterization of these color maps is introduced. \Cref{ss:colormaps:applying} discusses techniques that can be used to map the scalar data to the color maps. In the final section, \cref{ss:colormaps:variables}, the application of the color maps to the scalar variables in our application is discussed.
