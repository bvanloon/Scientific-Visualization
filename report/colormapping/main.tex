\chapter{Color Mapping} % (fold)
\label{cha:color_mapping}
Color mapping is widely used for the visualization of scalar data. This is done by associating a color with each scalar value that is visualized. In this chapter we will discuss the colormaps included in the application and how these colormaps are supported. In \cref{s:colormapping:method} the general methods used for colormapping is first explained as well as the parametrization and application of colormaps. Next \Cref{s:colormaps:differentmaps} highlights the important features of colormaps and discusses the colormaps that are implemented in our application. For each colormap that is provided the advantages and disadvantages are discussed, as well as a small motivation why it is included in the application. Finally, \cref{s:colormapping:results} shows the results of applying colormaps to the simulation and discusses these results.
