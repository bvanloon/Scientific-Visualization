\chapter{Color Mapping} % (fold)
\label{cha:color_mapping}
Color mapping is widely used for the visualization of scalar data. This is done by associating a color with each scalar value that is visualized. In this chapter we will discuss the color maps included in the application and how these color maps are supported. In \cref{s:colormapping:method} the general method used for color mapping is first explained as well as the parametrization and application of color maps. Next \Cref{s:colormaps:differentmaps} highlights the important features of color maps and discusses the color maps that are implemented in our application. For each color map that is provided in our application its advantages and disadvantages are mentioned, as well as a small motivation for its inclusion. Finally, \cref{s:colormapping:results} shows the results of applying color maps to the simulation and discusses these results.
