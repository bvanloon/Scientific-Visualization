\chapter{Color Mapping} % (fold)
\label{cha:color_mapping}

Color mapping is widely used for the visualization of scalar data. This is done by associating a color with the scalar value that is visualized. In this chapter we will discuss the colormaps included in the application and how these colormaps are supported. \Cref{s:colormapping:colormaps} highlights the important features of colormaps and discusses several color maps that are implemented. For each colormap its advantages and disadvantages are given as well as a small motivation why it is included in the application. The next section discusses how we have implemented our color maps. Finally, \cref{s:colormapping:results} shows the results of applying color maps to our data set.  

% In the next section, \Cref{s:colormaps:differentmaps}, several colormaps are discussed that are implemented in the application.  In \cref{ss:colormaps:parameterization} the parameterization of the color maps is introduced and \Cref{ss:colormaps:applying} discusses techniques that can be used to map the scalar data to the color maps. In the final section, \cref{ss:colormaps:variables}, the application of the color maps to the scalar variables in our application is discussed.
